<td>
<p>Transitioning to Adobe Journey Optimizer from another marketing platform is easier with guided capabilities that help you move existing email content and journeys into Journey Optimizer. A dedicated workspace lets you reuse what you have instead of rebuilding from scratch.</p>
<p>This capability is only available for a set of organizations (Limited Availability). To gain access, contact your Adobe representative.</p>
<GIF placeholder: to be added>
<Documentation link: TBD>

### 历程 {#july-26-journeys}

此版本中的历程添加了以下改进。

此版本中的营销活动添加了以下功能和改进。

<!--
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Inbound experience simulation in Action campaigns</strong><br/></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>You can now simulate inbound channel actions in Action campaigns before going live. Use simulation mode to test your configuration with simulated users and preview the rendered experience, including a generated URL and QR code, so you can validate rules, decisioning, and content rendering end-to-end.</p>
<p>This capability is only available for a set of organizations (Limited Availability). To gain access, contact your Adobe representative.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
-->

### 编排的营销活动 {#july-26-oc}

<!--

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Quiet Hours support for orchestrated campaigns</strong><br/></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>You can now apply quiet hours to Orchestrated campaigns. Quiet hours let you define time-based exclusions to prevent messages from being sent during specific periods, helping you respect customer preferences and compliance requirements across campaign orchestration use cases.</p>
<Documentation link: TBD>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* **Ability to Manage Profile Target Dimensions** - You can now delete a Profile Target Dimension or edit and swap its configured identity namespace, providing greater control and flexibility over your data setups.

* **Support for Line** - You can now add LINE actions directly into your Orchestrated campaigns. This new activity allows you to build and deliver highly personalized content, including text, stickers, images, videos, location data, and rich Flex Messages, to engage your customers seamlessly on the LINE platform. This capability is only available for a set of organizations (Limited Availability). To gain access, contact your Adobe representative.

* **New Orchestrated campaigns public APIs** - New API specifications are now available for Orchestrated campaigns. These APIs allow you to programmatically create, manage, and trigger orchestrated campaigns, enabling deeper integration with external systems and automation pipelines.

* **Personalize email sender details per recipient and campaign** - Orchestrated campaigns now support personalization of email header fields, including From name, From address, and Reply-To, using profile attributes or relational data. This allows sender details to reflect the relevant advisor, location, or branch for each recipient, rather than routing all sends through a single corporate address. Header values can be set at the channel level and overridden per campaign using contextual data for more precise control. Documentation link: TBD

* **Target dimension simplification in Orchestrated campaigns** - The active targeting dimension is now shown on the workflow canvas, so you can see which dimension is used by a channel activity. The multi-entity segmentation flow is simpler as you no longer need a separate "Change dimension" activity. Moreover, you can now choose explicitly whether messages are sent at the profile level or at a secondary dimension level.

* **Send messages in waves** - You can now schedule outbound messages from orchestrated campaigns to be delivered in controlled batches over time. Ideal for high-volume or time-sensitive campaigns, wave sending also supports better deliverability and helps maintain a strong sender reputation by reducing the risk of being flagged as spam.

### 渠道 {#july-26-channels}

此版本中的渠道添加了以下功能和改进。

### 决策 {#july-26-decisioning}

在此版本中，已向Decisioning添加了以下改进。

<!--
* **Placement-level frequency capping in Decisioning** - Frequency capping rules in Decisioning can now be scoped to individual placements, giving you finer control over how often an offer is shown in a given surface. Two modes are available: placement-specific capping (define a cap that applies only when the offer is displayed in a selected placement) and per-placement capping (apply a cap independently across every placement where the offer appears, so each placement maintains its own capping counter). Documentation link: TBD
-->

### 内容管理 {#july-26-content}

此版本中的内容管理添加了以下改进。

<!--
### Integrations {#july-26-integrations}

The following improvements have been added to integrations in this release.

* **Real-time countdown timers for Adobe Experience Manager Dynamic Media integration** - Marketers can now build countdown timers as Dynamic Media templates in Adobe Experience Manager and pull them directly into Journey Optimizer. Timers render live at the moment of open, so every recipient sees an accurate countdown, not a static image. Configure dates, styling, and fallback values right within the Journey Optimizer editor to power flash sales and limited-time offers. [Documentation link: TBD]
